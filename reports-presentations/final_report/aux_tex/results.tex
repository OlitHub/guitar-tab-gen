Our next steps include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Propose an evaluation metric to quantify the quality of the generated tablatures.
    \item Understand the code of the model proposed by Makris et al. using their Github repository.
    \item Adapt the model to our task and our data.
    \item Generate predictions with conditional information from several combinations of instruments.
