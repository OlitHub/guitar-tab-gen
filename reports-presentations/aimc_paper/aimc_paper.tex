\title{\LaTeX{} Conditional Generation of Bass Guitar Tablature for Guitar Accompaniment in Western Popular Music}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  The field of symbolic music generation has seen great advancements with the rise of transformer-based architectures.
  Addressing a specific need identified through a user study conducted on guitar players, we focus on developing AI tools to generate bass guitar tablatures conditioned on scores of other instruments in Western popular music.
  The bass guitar, a crucial component of the rhythmic and harmonic sections in music, presents a unique challenge due to its dual role in providing structure and groove.
  Building upon the tablature notation, the most popular way to share music among guitarists, this work adopts modern encoding schemes to integrate tablature representation into transformer-based models.
  To this end, the project involves preprocessing a large dataset of music scores and fine-tuning state-of-the-art transformer architectures.
  Due to the project being the first of its kind and its creative nature, the evaluation of the generated tablatures is mainly done qualitatively.
