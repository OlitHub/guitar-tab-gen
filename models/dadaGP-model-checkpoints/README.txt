	python packages required 
	might not be able to conda install everything

	python packages required
	maybe it's better to cross check this with the packages within "dadaGP-generation-conda-env-requirements.txt"
	it was a long time ago that I set up the environment I'm currently using, but it was painful
	this were the notes I took at the time, in case they are helpful:

		After a morning of struggles, â€¦
		For installation of pytorch-fast-transformers:

		(dadaCP) pps30@bibury:~$ python --version
		Python 3.7.10
		(dadaCP) pps30@bibury:~$ nvcc --version
		nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
		Copyright (c) 2005-2019 NVIDIA Corporation
		Built on Fri_Feb__8_19:08:17_PST_2019
		Cuda compilation tools, release 10.1, V10.1.105
		(dadaCP) pps30@bibury:~$ gcc --version
		gcc (GCC) 5.5.0

		(dadaCP) pps30@bibury:~$ conda list | grep torch
		torch                     1.5.1+cu101              pypi_0    pypi
		torchvision               0.6.1+cu101              pypi_0    pypi


		STILL, only shows when pip list, not when conda list.
		

- full-data-config_5_lat1024.yml
	
	main config file with all the parameters for generation and training

	folder containing:
		- model weights (from epoch 200, the best one we have)
		- a config file (mostly useless, but necessary for it to run; can be ignored)
