Learn about transformers. Try a DadaGP model to generate something and turn it to a score.

Tested DadaGP model on free generation.
I should try to better understand Pedro's code and generate only a bass guitar score if it is possible.
I can try to modify the prompt to generate only bass guitar scores.
Or I can put the probabilities of the tokens that are not bass guitar notes to zero.
This will give us a baseline.

Also try to generate specific style of music using the artist in the prompt.

How does DadaGP sample?
Also, read GTR-CTRL paper and try to understand the model.

I may have to retrain the model on bass guitar scores only or to at least fine-tune the model on bass guitar scores.
This will give us a better baseline.
I should create a kaggle or colab notebook for the training and inference as I will need computational resources.
Colab can connect to a github repository and I can use the free GPU provided by google.

Tried understanding the code from the DadaGP checkpoint. DadaGP seems to be a TransformerXL extended with MemTransformerLM.
Ask Pedro about this.

I tried generating an only bass guitar score using the prompt but it doesn't seem possible just like that.
My prompt was to start the generation with a note of bass guitar only. It delays the appearance of other instruments but they still appear after a while.
I also tried generating in the style of the Beatles as there is a consistent dataset of their songs.

GTR-CTRL:
CTRL model does conditional generation using categorization tokens appended to text sequences.
